Sub: Delayed Possession of Unit no. ______

 

Dear Mr._________ (Authorized representative of the builder company),

This is to bring to your kind notice that I am the buyer of Unit no. _____ of your __________ (Project name) and it is of huge concern to me that I have not received any official communication from ________ (Builder Company) regarding the confirmed date of handing over of the possession of the said Unit.



I have signed the Buyer’s Agreement with ________ (Builder Company) on _______ (Date). It was a commitment by the company that possession will be handed over in ___ months. Thereafter, it was told that by the end of _______ (Extension date, if any), the possession will be given. However, the possession of the unit was never delivered even after the expiry of the extension date.



I am sorry to say but the company has failed to keep its commitment and has lost the customer's faith as it has delayed the possession of the said unit innumerable times and there seems to be no deadline to this project. I have paid 80% of the amount and paying interest on it every month to the bank which is causing me a substantial financial burden.



Kindly let me know the final date of delivery of possession of my unit or else I would have to resort to taking appropriate legal actions against the company on account of the delays caused by you.

Looking forward to a favorable reply.



Regards,

_________ (Sender’s Name)
