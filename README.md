Because of the hardware limitations on the local machine, we could not generate and show the AI's output in time. However, we have attached an ipynb file that showcases the model's capacity to generate legal advice and act as an assistant.

We have used XAMPP to host the server locally and create our MySQL database. We have used PHP to manage the database.
